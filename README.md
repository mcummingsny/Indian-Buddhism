# Indian-Buddhism
Buddhist literature is vast and complex; attempting to present a few texts here as a precis of Buddhist thought would be futile at best and misleading at worst. A far better way to become acquainted with Buddhist literature is through the anthologies of translated texts that appear in "INDIAN BUDDHISM_SUGGESTED READINGS" in the list above. The few translations that do appear in this repository are specific to particular issues discussed in the lectures.

This repository is a work in progress. Check back regularly to find newly added documents.
