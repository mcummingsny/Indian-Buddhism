# Indian-Buddhism
The translations that appear in this repository are meant merely to accompany a few specific issues discussed in the lectures and are not comprehensive, or even representative, of a vast and complex Buddhist literature.  For those interesting in reading more, please see the anthologies of translated texts that are listed in "INDIAN BUDDHISM_SUGGESTED READINGS." 

And don't overlook the INDIAN BUDDHISM_GLOSSARY! Includes definitions of technical terms, lists of important scriptures and eminent monks, and a discussion of what is meant by the "schools" of Indian Buddhism.

This repository is a work in progress. Check back regularly to find newly added documents.
